# Online Crime Monitoring System
The Online Crime Monitoring System is a web-based application developed using Python and Django. It provides a centralized and user-friendly platform for real-time crime reporting, tracking, and analysis. The system allows citizens to securely register complaints online, while law enforcement agencies can efficiently manage cases, update investigation status, and maintain records.
This system addresses challenges in traditional crime reporting, such as delays, limited accessibility, and poor data sharing between citizens and authorities, and improves communication and response times.
